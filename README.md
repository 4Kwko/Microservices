# Microservices

This project was assigned to me as a student at Franciscan University (UFN). We were tasked with developing a brief summary of the microservices architecture and its relationship with databases and database management systems (DBMS).

The project has both a PT-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) and a Standard American English version. It builds on the first project and has direct relation to the previously submitted GitHub repository, extending the foundational work already completed.

The summary includes a concise explanation of what microservices are, their unique features, advantages and disadvantages, as well as their integration with traditional databases and DBMS. During the research, I explored how microservices interact with distributed databases and how various database technologies can support this architectural pattern.

The formatting standard for both versions follows ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas), the official Brazilian academic formatting norm. Although this is not a formal research paper, the standard was applied for the sake of practice.

The tools used were Microsoft Word (Office 2021), ChatGPT-4, and the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary.
